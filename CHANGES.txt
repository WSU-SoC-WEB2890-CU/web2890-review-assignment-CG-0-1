TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1. In the '_custom.scss' file, I changed the $primary and $secondary colors 
   ($teal-dark (#0d503c) and $teal-light (#20c997)) to $web-chocolate (#d9641e) and 
   $princeton-orange (#ed7d27), respectively.

   I changed the primary and secondary colors because I wanted those colors 
   to be similar to the $orange (#fd7e14) color.

2. In the '_custom.scss' file, I decided to change the $orange (#fd7e14) to 
   $cultured (#f7f7f7).

   I decided that there was too much $orange and that a new color had to replace it.

3. In the '_footer.scss' file, I changed the $orange color in stroke to $cultured.

   For the icons in the footer section to pop more.

4. In the '_buttons.scss' file, I added the 'i {color: $primary;}' and changed the 
   color inside te rgba() in the span {} of the &:hover to $cultured color.

   For the button to pop better when the user hovers the mouse over it.

5. Replaced all fake text with real text and altered some existing text.

   To reflect my personality as well as give the user a glimpse of what I'm able to do.

6. Replaced all the images in the 'services' folder.

   For the images to not only better reflect the title they're supposed to represent 
   but also so that their color matches with the $primary and $secondary colors of my 
   website.

7. Added an 'alert' component in the 'FAQ' section.

   To clarify to the user that I'll answer any question that isn't listed in the 
   'FAQ' section.

8. Added the 'progress' component as the last section of the webpage.

   Show that the user has finished reading all the main sections of the webpage.

9. Replaced all the images in the 'portfolio' folder

   For the new images to reflect their respective new titles and categories.

10. Created internal links in the navbar.

    Make it easier for the user to navigate the webpage using the links in the navbar.

11. Use '@media (max-width: 767.98px) {}' in '_faq.scss', '_footer.scss', and 
    '_get-started.scss'

    To make the reading in tablets and smaller devices more linear.
